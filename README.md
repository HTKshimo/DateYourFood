# DateYourFood
HackISU 2018 project by Shuang Li, Yamini Mathur, and Sydney Teh. 

This is an app that helps remind college students or anyone who has a busy schedule and always have to toss lots of fresh food from their fridge because they did not keep track of the expiration date of the food.

You can not only record expiration of food but also plan out what dish you like to cook on which day, so that the app knows which food is consumed and which still needs to be kept a record of the expiration date.
You can also choose to either manually type in the expiration date on the package or select the type of the food and let the system decide for you. The second option will come in handy when you buy fresh veggie or fruit that does not come in package or has a printed expiration date.
